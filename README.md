Emmersiv Web App:

This is the web application that I am building out for my project at West Health Institute. It is a series of web pages that 
utilizes single page design with AngularJS and BootStrap (for the horizontal navbar). Each page will have a data entry form
that can be used by physicians to enter in data concerning an Autism Spectrum Disorder evaluation. This data will be stored
on a MongoDB via Node.js. Then that data will be analyzed using Python. This repository is the starting point for the front-end.


- index.html is the main page
- login.html will be the linking login page to access data entry forms.
