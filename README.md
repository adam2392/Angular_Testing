This repo was written for the purposes of templating a way to show pages via angularJS. This is used by the clinical team at Emmersiv West Health Institute. This is the web application that I am building out for my project at West Health Institute. It is a series of web pages that utilizes single page design with AngularJS and BootStrap (for the horizontal navbar). Each page will have a data entry form that can be used by physicians to enter in data concerning an Autism Spectrum Disorder evaluation. This data will be stored on a MongoDB via Node.js. Then that data will be analyzed using Python. This repository is the starting point for the front-end.


##Setup## 
Please install angularJS into your lib folder, brackets (for easy web dev), latest version of Chrome.

##Functionality##
Open up folder in Brackets and then start a localhost session. Modify html files to show different things. Modify the routing files to add more options.

* See https://github.com/adam2392/emmersiv_webappcharts for the front end display of all the data using highCharts.
* See https://github.com/adam2392/emmersiv_webapp for the template of displaying pages via angularJS (can be implemented with the charting mechanisms)
