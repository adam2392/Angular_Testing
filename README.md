# Background
This repo was written for the purposes of templating a way to show pages via angularJS. This is used by the clinical team at Emmersiv West Health Institute. This is the web application that I am building out for my project at West Health Institute. It is a series of web pages that utilizes single page design with AngularJS and BootStrap (for the horizontal navbar). Each page will have a data entry form that can be used by physicians to enter in data concerning an Autism Spectrum Disorder evaluation. This data will be stored on a MongoDB via Node.js. Then that data will be analyzed using Python. This repository is the starting point for the front-end.

# Subdirectories
1. Angular Template
This is the angularjs template for displaying the webpage and then displaying the webcharts in an easy format.
2. Emmersiv Charts
This is the charts and the charting of data analytics from the emmersiv scheduler repo. Results are charted for easy visualization and analysis.
3. Emmersiv Webpage
This is the actual webpage coded in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Setup
Please install angularJS into your lib folder, brackets (for easy web dev), latest version of Chrome.

## Functionality
Open up folder in Brackets and then start a localhost session. Modify html files to show different things. Modify the routing files to add more options.
